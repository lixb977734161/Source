I spent 3 hours trying to find out why when I upload multiples file $_FILES  return empty, I did noticed it was only when I select files that exceed 3m so I thought it was something related to the MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE that for my surprice came as default as 20m which was very confusing. Later I discovery the problem was in the POST_MAX_SIZE been 3m, so it happen that not only MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE is responsible and that is why I'd like to know there is no error message that shows the cause.


$_FILES['userfile']['error'].
